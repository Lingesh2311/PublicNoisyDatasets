# Public Noisy Datasets

This repository contains the publicly available noisy datasets.

## 1. Consumer Complaint Database

Complaints are published after the company responds, confirming a commercial relationship with the consumer, or after 15 days, whichever comes first.<br/>
It is a **1.47 GB CSV** file.<br/>
